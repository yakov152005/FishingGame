                in this game currently you can catch two type of fish:  
                1.yellow fish -also called regular fish that worth 1 point every catch  
                2.gray fish - also called bonus fish that worth 3 points every catch! but It rarely spawns.
                
                But it's not that easy, the game also has Sharks and Puffer Fish that multiply faster as the score goes up 
                beyond the fact that you can't fish for a Shark, a shark can't touch the fishing line!
                for that the game starts with 3 lives, every time you touch a shark or puff fish one life goes down!
                
                ~ ! Pay attention !~
                In each level a new heart is created in the water, if you fish it you can increase the life.
                
                Game operation:
                1. Use the arrow keys to move the hook up and down, or W(for Up), S(for down).
                2. When a fish is caught on the rod, it must be brought up to the tip of the rod and only then press the 'SPACE BAR'
                As soon as you pressed the space key and the fish disappeared - a point was added to you.""";
